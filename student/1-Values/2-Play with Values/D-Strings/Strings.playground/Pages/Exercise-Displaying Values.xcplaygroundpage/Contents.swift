## Exercise: Displaying Values
 
 On an earlier playground, you had an exercise that involved calculating the space remaining on an iPhone. You were provided the following information:

- The capacity of an iPhone is measured in gigabytes (GB).
- The iPhone in question has 8GB of storage.
- A gigabyte is about 1,000 megabytes (MB).
- The phone already has 3GB of stuff on it.
- One minute of video takes 150MB of space.

 - callout(Exercise): Create a string that tells the user how many minutes of video they can store on the phone. You'll first need to perform the calculation steps, then use string interpolation to display the answer. Your result should look like this:

 `You can record XXX more minutes of video.`
 
 _Hint:_ Do all of your calculations in megabytes.

let iPhoneCapacityGB: Double = 8
let iPhoneStorageGB: Double = 3

let capacityMB: Double = iPhoneCapacityGB * 1000
let storageMB: Double = iPhoneStorageGB * 1000
let availableMB: Double = capacityMB - storageMB

let minutesOfVideo: Int = Int(availableMB / 150)

print("You can record \(minutesOfVideo) more minutes of video.")
