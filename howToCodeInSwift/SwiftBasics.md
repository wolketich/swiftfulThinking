# Swift Basics

## Intro
- **00:00** - Introduction to the session.
- **01:04** - Welcome message and an overview of what will be covered.

## Getting Started
- **02:49** - Installing Xcode: Step-by-step instructions on how to install Xcode on your Mac.
- **04:03** - Creating a Playground: How to create a new Playground in Xcode for practicing Swift.

## Swift Basics
- **05:16** - Swift Basics: Introduction to basic Swift syntax and concepts.
  - **Exercise 1:** Open a new Playground in Xcode and declare variables and constants using `var` and `let`. Assign different data types to these variables and constants.
  - **Exercise 2:** Write a simple Swift program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and prints the results to the console.
  - **Extra-Mile Challenge:** Create a program that takes user input for two numbers and performs all basic arithmetic operations on them, displaying the results.
  - **Interview Questions:**
    1. Explain the difference between `var` and `let` in Swift. When should you use each one?
    2. What are some common data types in Swift? How do they differ from each other?
    3. How does Swift handle integer overflow?
    4. How does Swift's type inference system work?

- **07:44** - Print to the Console: Learn how to use the `print` function to output text to the console.
  - **Exercise 1:** Create a Playground that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
  - **Exercise 2:** Use the `print` function to display the values of variables and constants you declared earlier.
  - **Extra-Mile Challenge:** Format the printed output to include descriptions, e.g., "The value of variable x is: [value]".
  - **Interview Questions:**
    1. How can you format strings in Swift? Provide examples of different formatting techniques.
    2. What are some differences between `print` and `debugPrint` in Swift?
    3. How can you use string interpolation in Swift?
    4. What are some advanced features of Swift's `print` function?

- **09:19** - Writing Comments: How to write single-line comments in Swift.
  - **Exercise 1:** Add single-line comments to your Playground code explaining what each line does.
  - **Exercise 2:** Write a short explanation about the difference between single-line comments and multi-line comments.
  - **Extra-Mile Challenge:** Research and write a brief comment on the importance of comments in collaborative projects.
  - **Interview Questions:**
    1. Why are comments important in code? Provide examples of good and bad commenting practices.
    2. How can comments help in maintaining and debugging code?
    3. What are some best practices for writing comments in Swift?
    4. How do comments affect code compilation and performance?

- **11:15** - Multi-line Comments: How to write multi-line comments in Swift.
  - **Exercise 1:** Add multi-line comments to your Playground code that provide a summary of the code's purpose.
  - **Exercise 2:** Write a multi-line comment block explaining the concept of variables and constants in Swift.
  - **Extra-Mile Challenge:** Document a small code snippet with extensive multi-line comments, explaining each part of the code.
  - **Interview Questions:**
    1. What are the benefits of using multi-line comments over single-line comments?
    2. How can you use multi-line comments for documentation purposes?
    3. Provide examples of scenarios where multi-line comments are particularly useful.
    4. How can multi-line comments be used to create documentation in Swift?

- **12:43** - Naming Conventions: Best practices for naming variables, constants, and functions in Swift.
  - **Exercise 1:** Refactor your Playground code to follow Swift's naming conventions for variables and constants.
  - **Exercise 2:** Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. Name the function and its parameters following Swift's naming conventions.
  - **Extra-Mile Challenge:** Research and implement Swift's naming conventions for classes and methods in a simple class-based example.
  - **Interview Questions:**
    1. What are the naming conventions for variables, constants, and functions in Swift?
    2. Why is it important to follow naming conventions in a collaborative project?
    3. How do Swift's naming conventions differ from those in other programming languages?
    4. How can naming conventions improve code readability and maintenance?

## Wrapping Up
- **16:45** - Wrapping up the session and a brief overview of what was covered.
  - **Exercise 1:** Summarize what you have learned in this session in a multi-line comment.
  - **Exercise 2:** Create a simple program that combines all the concepts learned in this session. For example, a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle and prints the results to the console.
  - **Extra-Mile Challenge:** Extend your program to handle multiple rectangles, storing their dimensions in an array and iterating over it to calculate and print the area and perimeter for each rectangle.
  - **Interview Questions:**
    1. How can you use arrays in Swift to store multiple values? Provide examples.
    2. What are some common methods for iterating over arrays in Swift?
    3. How can you optimize your code for better performance when working with arrays?
    4. What are some advanced features of arrays in Swift?
